# Fractures

Fractures is a collection of low level atomic utilities for humans that makes products more resilient, composable and scalable. Only the good parts.

- Atomic
- Framework agnostic
- No UI
- Fast in every way
- Manageable cognitive load
- Small footprint

### This repo publishes 3 packages:

- `@heliosgraphics/fractures` Atomic CSS.
- `@heliosgraphics/library` Types and constraints of visual spaces, no presets or definitions.
- `@heliosgraphics/utils` Helpers functions for both.

### Roadmap

- `2024` Fractures as a template repository for agents to build from.
